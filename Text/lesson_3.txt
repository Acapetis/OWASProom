The Integrity failure vulnerability in software applications is similar to a tampered document. A tampered document may have altered information or missing pages, making it difficult to trust the authenticity and accuracy of the document.
Similarly, in software applications, the integrity of data can be compromised if attackers are able to modify or tamper with the data. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security issues.
