The Security Misconfiguration vulnerability in software applications is similar to leaving a door unlocked or a window open. Even if the building has strong locks, a misconfiguration can create an opportunity for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
Similarly, in software applications, security misconfigurations can occur if there are misconfigured settings or default configurations that are not changed. Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or execute malicious code.
