The Broken Access Control vulnerability in software applications is similar to a building with a broken door that can be easily opened by anyone. The broken door makes it difficult to control who has access to the building.
Similarly, in software applications, broken access control can occur if there are flaws in the mechanisms that control user access. Attackers can exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions that they shouldn't be able to do.
