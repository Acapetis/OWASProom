The Cryptographic failure vulnerability in software applications is similar to a locked safe that can be easily opened with a simple key. The safe may appear secure, but the weak lock makes it vulnerable to attacks.
Similarly, in software applications, cryptographic failure can occur if weak encryption algorithms or keys are used. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute malicious code.
