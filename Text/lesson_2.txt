The Outdated Component vulnerability in software applications is similar to having an outdated ID card. The ID card may have outdated information, making it easier for someone else to use it to gain unauthorized access to secure buildings.

Similarly, outdated components such as libraries and plugins in software applications can have known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to the application. This can lead to data breaches and other security issues.
