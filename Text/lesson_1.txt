in software applications, components such as libraries and plugins can become outdated and vulnerable to known security issues. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the application, steal data, or execute malicious code.
Imagine that you have a house with a lock on the front door to keep intruders out. However, the lock is an old, outdated model that is known to be vulnerable to picking and other forms of attack. Even though you have a lock, your house is still at risk because of the outdated and vulnerable lock.
To address this vulnerability, it is important to regularly update all components used in the application, including plugins and libraries, with the latest security patches and versions. This is similar to replacing an outdated lock on a house with a more secure one.
